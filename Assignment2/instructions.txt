After extracting the zip file, just put the files test-classification-models.py 
and test-regression-models.py in the main folder.

Then run 'python test-classification-models.py' 

If errors are thrown, evaluate the method(s) that did not pass the test. 

For some tests, prints with the betas (or thetas) are shown with the expected values. 

Go over the tests to ensure you understand what is being tested.
